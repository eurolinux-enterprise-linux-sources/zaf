* Pacakges can contain hyph, spell and thes with various locales

* Allow different encodings for input word lists (maybe specified in the wordlist)
* Packaging:
	- auto create debs
	- auto create rpms
* Specify different ways to use words in the wordlist.  Maybe regex based.  eg.
  Abandon words that have spaces or split words with spaces.  Or if you see
  this char then split the word otherwise drop.  This would allow us to have
  complete wordlists and drop what we don't need.  If the spellcheckers catch
  up then we still have the data.
* Look at auto creation of docs.  Eg install instructions, version numbers
  within docs.
* Auto upload
* Download in cases like en-ZA that use en-GB as source
* Allow different wordlist preprocessing rules for each spellchecker type (eg
  MySpell doesn't care about letters or strange characters while Aspell does)

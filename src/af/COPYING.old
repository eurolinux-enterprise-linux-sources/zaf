This is a message for the accompaning file AFR_DBF.ZIP:

That file contains a list of Afrikaans words. It is PKZIP-ed (PKZIP 2.04g) and 
posted in binary from a DOS platform.

This list was compiled in personal capacity since 1984. Many works were 
referenced, but the major part of the list was compiled by myself.

Users of the list agree, by using it, to the following:

1) The list is used entirely at own risk. I will not be held liable for any 
   mistakes, ommisions, law suites etc.
2) The use of the list as it was posted, is for personal use only.
3) As there were many sources for the list, credit cannot be given to all
   sources. It is suggested that any commercial use of part of the list
   should first be vetted by lawers.
4) Commercial use of the list, as it is, should first be cleared out with me.
5) If the user of the list makes alterations to the list, the list then becomes
   the property of that user. I then relinquish all rights (and all 
   responsibility) of any sort to the list. 

I hope this makes sence and that you find it agreeable?

Greetings
Bernard Nieuwoudt
